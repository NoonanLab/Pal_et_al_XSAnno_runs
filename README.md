# XSAnno run to create a human-chimpanzee consensus annotation (hg38 and panTro6 genome builds). The annotation is based on GENCODEv43. 

Most of the scripts are the same as in https://github.com/YingZhuLab/XSAnno, but modifications have been made. Input files, additional scripts and output files are attached.
